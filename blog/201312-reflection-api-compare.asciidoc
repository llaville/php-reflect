Compare both Reflection API between PHP5 and Reflect.

A big improvement was added to API on its way to exploit results.

- API 1.0 provides a raw array structure that is difficult to exploit. 
- API 2.0 provides an OOP like PHP5 that is very simple to explore and exploit.

Look at

between PHP5 and Reflect 2.
