At one month of end of year 2013, I've decided to open officially the blog dedicated to PHP Reflect.

After few weeks of development to rewrite a new major API 2.0, that make,
it will be more easy exploit parsing results,
I think it's now time allow readers to follow my work.

Before the launch of first release candidate, I'll introduce in next days the features
of this new version.
