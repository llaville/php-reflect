A new core code for the second release candidate of version 2.0

After lot of test on huge source code, like Zend Framework 1.12, I've be faced
on a major performance issue with the first RC code.

This is the reason, why I've decided to rewrite the core code of PHP Reflect one times again.

Even if I'm still under test protocol, I got good results, and
the second release candidate of version 2.0 should come very soon now (probably next week).
