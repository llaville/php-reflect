ifdef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:migration-guide.html[migration guide]

xref:_migration_guide[]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]
in case you are upgrading from a version 1.x of PHP Reflect.

=== Requirements

Before you install PHP [label label-primary]#Reflect#, you will need an operating system
with http://www.php.net[PHP] 5.4.0 or later installed,

[label label-primary]#Reflect# requires the
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.datetime.php[date],
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php[json],
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php[reflection],
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.tokenizer.php[tokenizer],
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.phar.php[phar],
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php[pcre], and
http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php[spl] extensions.
These extensions are usually compiled and enabled by default.

=== Composer

Put a file named [label label-default]#composer.json# at the root of your project, with the content below:
[source,json]
----
{
    "require": {
        "bartlett/php-reflect": "4.2.2"
    }
}
----
And ask http://getcomposer.org/[Composer] to install the dependencies:
[source,bash]
----
$ php composer.phar install
----
Or just invoke Composer to install the latest version:
[source,bash]
----
$ php composer.phar require bartlett/php-reflect
----

[TIP]
====
With composer `install` or `create-project` commands,
if you want to disable installation of require-dev packages
(`doctrine/cache`, `psr/log`, `monolog/monolog`, `bartlett/phpunit-loggertestlistener`),
don't forget to specify the `--no-dev` option.
====

[TIP]
====
You can also use Composer to create a new project from an existing [label label-primary]#Reflect# package.
This is the equivalent of doing a git clone checkout followed by a composer install of the vendors.

[source,bash]
----
$ php composer.phar create-project bartlett/php-reflect /path/to/install 4.2.2
----
Where +/path/to/install+ is your install directory.
====

=== PHAR

The recommended way for newbies, or just to have a look on features of this library, is to download
a PHP Archive that contain all required dependencies of PHP [label label-primary]#Reflect#
bundled in a single file.

[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
$ chmod +x phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
$ mv phpreflect-4.2.2.phar /usr/local/bin/phpreflect
$ phpreflect
----

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it.
[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
$ php phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
----
