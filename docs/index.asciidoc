== Features

[role="lead"]
PHP_Reflect is a PHP Library that adds the ability to reverse-engineer classes, interfaces, functions, constants, namespaces and more.

*Why PHP_Reflect is different to standard PHP5 Reflection API ?*

With PHP5 http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php[Reflection] API
the code to analyze needs to be loaded and interpreted by the php interpreter,
and in certain cases, this triggers fatal errors.

With PHP [label label-primary]#Reflect# you don't have to trust in source code, because it will be parsed
with tokenizer extension.

almost equivalent to PHP5 reflection.

[medium]*Solid Foundation*

Whenever possible wheel reinvention was avoided. [label label-primary]#Reflect# uses code from well-known projects
including http://www.symfony.com/[Symfony] Finder, and EventDispatcher.

You don't find the feature you're searching for. [label label-primary]#Reflect# may be
extended easily, without having to hack the code.
