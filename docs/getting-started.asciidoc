== Download

We distribute a http://www.php.net/phar[PHP Archive] (PHAR) that contains
all required dependencies of PHP [label label-primary]#Reflect# bundled in a single file.

ifdef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}["Download the latest version",role="primary",icon="glyphicon-download-alt",options="block,white"]
endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]
ifndef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}[Download the latest version]
endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]

Make it executable, and put it into your `$PATH`.
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x phpreflect-2.4.0-beta.phar
$ mv phpreflect-2.4.0-beta.phar /usr/local/bin/phpreflect

$ phpreflect --version
----

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it.
[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpreflect-2.4.0-beta.phar
$ php phpreflect-2.4.0-beta.phar --version
----

With both methods then you have this output :

[role="output"]
====
----
phpReflect version 2.4.0-beta build ...
----
====
NOTE: [big]#...# represents the Git commit hash of this version

Other alternative installations are possible.

for details on how to do this.

[role="col-md-6"]
== Configuration
[source,json]
.With the minimalist JSON file +phpreflect.json+
----
{
    "source-providers": [
        {
            "in": ". as current",
            "name": "/\\.(php|inc|phtml)$/"
        }
    ],
    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "Analyser",
            "class": "Bartlett\\Reflect\\Plugin\\Analyser\\AnalyserPlugin"
        }
    ],
    "analysers" : [
        {
            "name": "Structure",
            "class": "Bartlett\\Reflect\\Analyser\\StructureAnalyser"
        }
    ]
}
----
Put it in your project's folder. Alternative locations are possible.
Please refer to the
ifdef::basebackend-html[]

== Structure

source-providers::
this entry provide list of your data sources to parse.
+
[TIP]
====
Like [label label-primary]#Reflect# always needs a JSON file to run, Remi Collet
https://github.com/llaville/php-compat-info/issues/120#issuecomment-46188900[shared]
a workaround solution exposed here that allows to run :
[source,bash]
----
$ phpreflect analyser:run .
----
====

plugins::
this entry list all plugins added to the core base code of PHP Reflect.
+
CAUTION: Don't forget to add at least this default content, else the `analyser:run`
and `analyser:list` commands wouldn't be available.

analysers::
this entry list all analysers that may be used with the `analyser:run` command.
+
IMPORTANT: Don't miss it, else you could not run the `analyser:run` command.

[role="col-md-12 clearfix"]
== Execution

With a default +phpreflect.json+ as detailed above, put in the +src/+ folder of the
[label label-primary]#Reflect# source code, and invoke the following command :
[source,bash]
----
$ phpreflect analyser:run .
----
and you should obtain something like this :

[role="output"]
====
----
include::structure_analysis.out.asciidoc[]
