== Download

We distribute a http://www.php.net/phar[PHP Archive] (PHAR) that contains
all required dependencies of PHP [label label-primary]#Reflect# bundled in a single file.

endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]
ifndef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}[Download the latest version]
endif::basebackend-bootstrap[]

Make it executable, and put it into your `$PATH`.
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
$ mv phpreflect-4.2.2.phar /usr/local/bin/phpreflect

$ phpreflect --version
----

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it.
[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpreflect-4.2.2.phar
$ php phpreflect-4.2.2.phar --version
----

With both methods then you have this output :
